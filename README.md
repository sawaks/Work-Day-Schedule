# Work-Day-Schedule
This project is the proof that I learned through week 5. Especially, the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/)is an important library that I need to use for this project.


## My Task
Add on the system by JavaScript(Jquery) and make it successfully produced as a simple calendar application. Also, follow the acceptance criteria and try to code feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Main particular points
* Create HTML DOM elements with JavaScript.
* Use for loop, produce some functions.
